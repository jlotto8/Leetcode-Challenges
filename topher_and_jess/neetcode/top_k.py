Top K Frequent Elements
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.
The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.
You may return the output in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1
Output: [7]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.

Hint 1
A naive solution would be to count the frequency of each number and then sort the array based on each elementâ€™s frequency. After that, we would select the top k frequent elements. This would be an O(nlogn) solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way?

Hint 2
Can you think of an algorithm which involves grouping numbers based on their frequency?

Hint 3
Use the bucket sort algorithm to create n buckets, grouping numbers based on their frequencies from 1 to n. Then, pick the top k numbers from the buckets, starting from n down to 1.

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2
Output: [2,3]
